# Node starter

Simple project setup that I use as a base for small scripts and js/ts files that don't fit anywhere else.

features:

- `tsconfig.json` set up to support [Node's type stripping](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/typescript.html#type-stripping)
- Prettier
- Vitest
- Vscode `launch.json` to run and debug the currently active file
